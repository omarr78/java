## Introduction to Program Execution and Threads

### 1. How a Program is Developed and Executed

When developing a program, the first step is to **write it in a high-level language** such as C, C++, or Java.

However, **computers only understand binary (0s and 1s)** — not high-level code. Therefore, the program must be converted into machine code.

**🔄 Compilation:**

* A **compiler** is used to translate the high-level code into **machine code**.
* This binary machine code is known as an **executable file**.

But just compiling isn’t enough. For a program to run:

* The **Operating System (OS)** loads the executable into **memory**.
* The OS allocates **resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.)** to execute it.

Before it starts execution, the program is just a **passive file**. Once it starts executing:

> ✅ **It becomes a process.**

### 2. What is a Process?

> A **process** is an instance of a program that is being executed.

In early computers, only one process could run at a time. Today, modern systems support **multiple processes** simultaneously, and even **a single program can produce multiple processes**.

### - Memory layout of a single process

| Segment          | Purpose                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Segment** | Contains the executable instructions of the program (read-only).                |
| **Data Segment** | Stores global and static variables that are initialized.                        |
| **Heap**         | Used for dynamically allocated memory.                  |
| **Stack**        | Stores function call information, local variables, return addresses.            |
| **Registers**    | Small storage locations in the CPU that hold data temporarily during execution. |

> **_NOTE:_**  Each process has a separate memory address space

#### Advantages

- Isolation: One process cannot access or corrupt the memory of another process.
- Improves system security and stability.

#### Disadvantages
- Context Switch Overhead: Switching between processes takes more time because the system must save and load separate memory contexts.

### 3. What is a Thread?

> A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
> 
> A **thread** is a lightweight process.

A process can have:

* **One thread** → Single-threaded
* **Multiple threads** → Multi-threaded

Each **thread** represents a **separate path of execution**.

> **_NOTE:_**    All threads within a single process share the same memory address space.

---

### 4. Components of a Thread

Each thread contains:

* **Thread ID**
* **Program Counter** (points to the current instruction)
* **Register Set**
* **Stack**

Threads within the **same process** share:

* **Code section**
* **Data section**
* **Heap**
* **Open files**
* **Operating system resources**

This shared structure makes **thread creation efficient.**

## Benefits of Multithreaded Programming

### 1. Responsiveness

* In interactive applications, a thread can continue execution even if others are blocked (Apps don’t freeze during slow operations).
* Example: A word processor that allows typing while saving a file in the background.

### 2. Resource Sharing

* Threads share memory and resources of the process.
* Efficient memory usage and faster communication between threads.

### 3. Economy

* Creating threads requires fewer resources than creating full processes.
* Context switching between threads is less expensive.

### 4. Utilization of Multiprocessor Architectures

* On multi-core systems, threads can run **truly in parallel**.
* Improves **concurrency** and speeds up processing.

### 5. Better resource usage

* While one thread waits for I/O, another can use the CPU.

## 🌐 Real-World Example of Multithreading: **Web Servers**

### Web Servers and Multithreading

Web servers (like **Apache**, **Nginx**, or **Tomcat**) are a **classic real-world example** of multithreaded applications.

> ⚙️ **Use Case**: Handling multiple client requests **simultaneously**.

---

### 🔄 Problem Without Threads

If a server handled each client request by **creating a new process**, it would:

* Consume a lot of memory.
* Introduce high overhead for **process creation and context switching**.
* Respond **slower**, especially under heavy load.

---

### ✅ Multithreading Solution

Instead of creating a new **process** for each client:

* The server creates a **new thread** to handle each incoming request.
* All threads **share the same process memory**, which includes code, data, and network resources.
* This allows for **faster context switching** and **less resource usage**.

---

### What Each Thread Does

Each thread:

* Accepts a client connection.
* Reads the HTTP request.
* Fetches or processes the requested data.
* Sends the HTTP response back to the client.

Multiple threads can do this **concurrently** for different users.

Client 1 |                  |
-------->|  Thread 1        |
         |                  |
         |  Web Server App  |
Client 2 |                  |
-------->|  Thread 2        |
         |                  |
Client 3 |                  |
-------->|  Thread 3        |
         +------------------+
         (All threads share code & resources)
```
