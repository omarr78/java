| State         | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NEW           | Thread is created but not started yet.                                                               |
| RUNNABLE      | Thread is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.                                                  |
| RUNNING       | Thread is executing (picked by CPU).                                                                 |
| BLOCKED       | Thread is waiting to acquire a monitor lock (e.g., synchronized block).                              |
| WAITING       | Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform an action (e.g., `join()` or `wait()`). |
| TIMED_WAITING | Thread is waiting for a specified time (e.g., `sleep()`, `join(timeout)`, or `wait(timeout)`).       |
| TERMINATED    | Thread has finished execution or exited due to an error.                                             |

### Example: Transition Overview

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running...");
});

System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW

t.start();
System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE (maybe still running)

t.join();
System.out.println(t.getState()); // TERMINATED
```
