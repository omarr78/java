# Hashing

- Hashing is a technique of converting an element or a value into a fixed size key,  
  that is used to uniquely identify that element from the group of similar  
  elements.  
- In other words, hashing is a process of mapping an element or a value with a  
  unique key.  
- In hashing, a hash function is used, which takes the value (element) as an input  
  and generates the fixed size key also known as hash code as an output. The  
  generated hash code is thus used as the index position at which the value  
  associated with the key is stored.
